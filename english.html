        <p class="intro__text">According to VTSIOM surveys, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend a vacation 
          in their native country. Like, what didn't we see here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the South, 
          the dense forests of the Sayan mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can see all these beauties without millions 
          on your account, a foreign passport and many hours of flights. For example, Vera Bashmakova-a brave young mother who took three children 
          in her arms, sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some 
          interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

              First of all, because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes dotted with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
              And if you open the car Windows, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places-the mountain air.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in the summer. So you will see all the variety
              local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous
              manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai territory.</p>

              the pines are more than half a Millennium old. Touch a living being who saw the sun before Ivan the terrible saw it.
              You can't find a trail for a hundred kilometers in a virgin forest. And on rare paths trees
